    "print(X)\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:- The output will be 'iNeuron'. Although X is set to 'NI!' inside the function func(), this assignment does not affect the global variable X. The print(X) statement after calling func() prints the global X, not the X inside func().\n",

    "func()\n",
    "print(X)\n",

    "Ans:-The output will be 'NI' followed by 'iNeuron'. Inside the function func(), X is set to 'NI', and this value is printed. However, this does not affect the global variable X, which remains 'iNeuron'.\n",

    "X = 'NI'\n",
    "func()\n",
    "print(X)\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:-The output will be 'NI'. The keyword global inside the function func() indicates that X refers to the global variable X. Therefore, when we set X to 'NI' inside func(), it changes the global variable X.\n",

    "5. What about this code—what’s the output, and why?\n",

    "def func():\n",

    "nested()\n",
    "func()\n",
    "X\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:-The output will be 'NI' followed by 'iNeuron'. The function nested() prints the value of X in its containing function’s scope, which is 'NI'. However, this does not affect the global variable X, which remains 'iNeuron'.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. How about this code: what is its output in Python 3, and explain?\n",
    "\n",
    "def func():\n",
    "X = 'NI'\n",
    "def nested():\n",
    "nonlocal X\n",
    "X = 'Spam'\n",
    "nested()\n",
    "print(X)\n",
    "func()\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:- The output will be 'Spam'. The keyword nonlocal inside the function nested() indicates that X refers to the nearest enclosing scope that contains an X, excluding the global scope. Therefore, when we set X to 'Spam' inside nested(), it changes the X in its containing function’s scope.\n"
